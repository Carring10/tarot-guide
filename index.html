    <h1>Major Arcana</h1>
    <p>The Major Arcana cards represent the life lessons and the archetypal themes that are
      influencing your life and
      journey to enlightenment. The Fool is the main character of the Major Arcana and makes his journey through each of
      the cards, meeting new teachers and learning new life lessons along the way, and eventually reaching the
      completion
      of his journey with the World card. This is known as the Fool's Journey and is a helpful way of understanding the
      story line of the Major Arcana Tarot card meanings.</p>

            you are
            unsure of exactly what will happen next.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">If you have recently experienced a period of excess, Temperance Reversed is your
            invitation to restore balance and moderation as soon as possible. It can also be a sign you sense that
            something is ‘off’ in your life, creating stress and tension. Life is not flowing as easily as you had
            hoped. Focus on your long-term vision and higher purpose and seek to align your daily activities with this
            vision.
