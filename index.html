            waiting on better timing, but balance this out with knowing this is a sign to take a step forward even if
            you are
            unsure of exactly what will happen next.</p>

            Knowledge of how to fix any issues will not come from thinking and rationalizing, but by tapping into and

            and are burnt out or stressed, the Strength card encourages you to find the power within yourself to

          <p>The Devil card represents your darker side and the negative forces that constrain you and hold
            you back from being the best version of yourself. You may be at the effect of negative habits, dependencies,
            behaviors, thought patterns, relationships, and addictions. You have found yourself trapped between the
            short-term pleasure you receive and the longer-term pain you experience.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Release, break-through</p>
          <p>The Devil Reversed can often appear when you are on the verge of a break-through or an up-levelling. You
            are being called to your highest potential, but first, you must let go of any unhealthy attachments or
            limiting beliefs that may hold you back. Often, when you are called to something ‘more’, you must deal with
            your shadows before you can step into this new version of yourself. </p>

          <p class="card-summary">When The Tower card appears in a Tarot reading, expect the unexpected – massive
            change, upheaval, destruction and chaos. It's an event that shakes you to your core, affecting you
            spiritually, mentally and physically. The best way forward is to let this structure self-destruct so you can
            re-build and re-focus.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Tower Reversed suggests that you are undergoing a significant personal
            transformation and upheaval. This differs from the experience of The Tower Upright where the change is often
            because of external circumstances and may even feel forced upon you. Instead, with The Tower Reversed, you
            are instigating the change and calling into question your fundamental belief systems, values, purpose, and
            meaning.</p>

            many challenges and stripped yourself bare of any limiting beliefs that have previously held you back. You
            are making some significant changes in your life, transforming yourself from the old you to the new you and,

          <p class="card-summary">The Star Reversed also shows that you are disengaged and uninspired with life or
            components of your life. Perhaps you started out with great vision and enthusiasm, but you are now finding
            yourself overwhelmed by day-to-day routines that are boring and dreary. Reconnect to what is truly important
            to you and you will find new sources of inspiration.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Moon represents your fears and illusions and often comes out when you are

            memory that caused emotional distress, and rather than dealing with the emotions you pushed them down deep
            into your subconscious. Now, these emotions are making a reappearance, and you may find yourself under their
            influence on a conscious or subconscious level. To remedy this, connect with your subconscious mind and
            release any fears or anxieties holding you back.</p>

            anxiety, and now the negative influences of these energies are subsiding. You are working through your fears
            and anxieties, understanding the impact they have on your life and how you can free yourself from such
            limiting beliefs. This is a truly liberating and transformational experience.</p>

            have been waiting for: that things will get better, a lot better! Through the challenges along your path,
            you discovered who you are and why you’re here.</p>

            have experienced setbacks that damaged your enthusiasm and optimism and perhaps led you to question whether
            you can achieve what you set out to do. Nonetheless, The Sun is never a negative card, so this is only
            temporary. The obstacles you see can be easily removed if you put your mind to it. It may just take a bit
            more effort than usual.</p>
