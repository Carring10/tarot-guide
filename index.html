      <p>The Major Arcana cards represent the life lessons and the archetypal themes that are
        influencing your life and
        journey to enlightenment. The Fool is the main character of the Major Arcana and makes his journey through each
        of
        the cards, meeting new teachers and learning new life lessons along the way, and eventually reaching the
        completion
        of his journey with the World card. This is known as the Fool's Journey and is a helpful way of understanding
        the
        story line of the Major Arcana Tarot card meanings.</p>

            opportunity, The Fool
            encourages you to throw caution to the wind and prepare to embrace the unknown. This is about taking a leap

            waiting on better timing, but balance this out with knowing this is a sign to take a step forward even if
            you are
            unsure of exactly what will happen next.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Imbalance, excess, re-alignment</p>
          <p class="card-summary">If you have recently experienced a period of excess, Temperance Reversed is your
            invitation to restore balance and moderation as soon as possible. It can also be a sign you sense that
            something is ‘off’ in your life, creating stress and tension. Life is not flowing as easily as you had
            hoped. Focus on your long-term vision and higher purpose and seek to align your daily activities with this
            vision.

      <p>In tarot, the element of cups is water, and the suit of cups pertains to situations and events of an emotional
        nature – in contradistinction to physical, or mindful, or creative natures; physical would refer to the
        understanding with the five senses, mindfulness would refer to mental constructs and logical sequences, and
        creative would refer to the agility of transcending limits, if so desired). As such, when the tarot is
        used in divination, many cups signify an emotional issue or love situation, or some event that affects the
        querent emotionally.</p>

      <h1>Swords</h1>
      <p>The Suit of Swords Tarot card meanings are associated with action, change, force, power, oppression, ambition,
        courage and conflict. Swords mirror the quality of mind present in your thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs. Action
        can be constructive and/or destructive, swords are often double-edged and in this way the Suit of Swords
        symbolises the fine balance between intellect and power and how these two elements can be used for good or evil.

          <p class="card-summary">The Page of Wands reversed can indicate that your eagerness to start something new has
            been hampered by complexities, obstacles and opposition, which has resulted in a lack of motivation and
            indecisiveness about your path forward. You may be
            allowing limiting beliefs and inner fears and anxieties to get in the way of achieving your dreams.</p>

            your mission and your dreams. You don’t really care if danger lies ahead – in fact, if it does, then it
            becomes all the more exciting and thrilling for you. Adventures like this light you up because you know
            growth and expansion are waiting on the other side. Be a pioneer and take calculated risks to reach new

          <p class="card-summary">The Knight of Wands reversed also suggests that you are at risk of acting impulsively,
            doing or saying things that you may later regret. You want everything to be ‘fixed’ straight away, but you
            do not allow yourself the time to think through what is best for you. Be careful, too, that you are not
            reacting instantly to everything that happens. Give your circumstances some space and time before you take
            action.</p>
