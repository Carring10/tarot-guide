            life. It undoubtedly comes as a welcome invitation – but it is not a free ride. As with all Aces in the
            Tarot deck, this card illustrates the possibility of a new endeavour but does not guarantee its
            manifestation or success. That piece is up to you.</p>

            feasibility of your idea and its potential outcomes. Perform your due diligence and figure out if this
            opportunity is meant for you or not.</p>
