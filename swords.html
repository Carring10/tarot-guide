          <p class="card-summary">The Ace of Swords marks a wave of new energy from the intellectual realms. You may be
            on the verge of a
            significant breakthrough or a new way of thinking that allows you to view the world with clear eyes. Or, you
            may have a sudden realization or conscious understanding about an issue that has been troubling you and can
            finally see the path ahead of you.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Ace of Swords reversed can also suggest clouded judgement and lack of mental
            clarity around a specific
            situation. You are missing relevant information or evidence that will help you decide, so invest your time
            and energy into seeking out the truth rather than just taking things at face value.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Difficult decisions, weighing up options, an impasse, avoidance</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Two of Swords indicates that you are facing a challenging decision, but you are
            unclear about which option to take. Both possibilities may seem equally good – or equally bad – and you are
            stumped about which will lead you to the best outcome. You must be able to weigh up the pros and cons of
            each choice and then make a conscious judgment. Use both your head and your
            heart to choose the path best for you.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Two of Swords reversed suggests that you are caught between a rock and a hard
            place, and it feels
            impossible to make the ‘right’ decision as you believe either option will lead to negative consequences. As
            a result, you are finding yourself feeling stuck and unable to move forward, which is just making the
            situation worse.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Three of Swords comes as a reminder that pain, sorrow and grief are a necessary
            part of life. Without pain, you would never experience the challenges you need to grow and develop as a
            person. Every hardship creates discomfort, which inevitably turns into an opportunity to become stronger,
            learn from your mistakes, and change the course of your life for the better. While the pain may cloud your
            vision for a time, it will eventually bring clarity and enable you to put the past behind you.</p>

            this card suggests that this time
            has passed, and you are on the path to recovery, realising that with every cloud comes a silver lining and
            you have other things in your life which bring you joy. You have reached a point where you can accept the
            pain and are ready to move forward.</p>

            reserves are running low or on empty. If you do not stop and take some much-needed rest now, you may crash

            point of view is so important to you that you’re willing to put your relationships in jeopardy, or if you
            can compromise and see eye-to-eye.</p>
