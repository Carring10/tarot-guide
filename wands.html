          <p class="flavor-text">Inspiration, new opportunities, growth, potential</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Ace of Wands encourages you to follow your heart and live your passion. If you
            feel a strong pull towards a new project or path, but are questioning whether it will work, then this card
            gives you a gentle nudge to pursue your passion. You can always start out small, treating the project or
            idea as an experiment or trial. Let your energy, dedication and motivation be your guides.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">An emerging idea, lack of direction, distractions</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The reversed Ace of Wands can suggest that you are finding it difficult to define your
            purpose in life and what you want to create. This lack of direction may sap your energy and leave you
            unmotivated and uninspired. To remedy this stagnation, you need first to focus on where your true passions
            lie. So, take time to contemplate what it is you aspire to and what you wish to achieve out of this
            situation.</p>

            comfort zone and explore new worlds and experiences. It may take courage to set out, but this card gives you
            the confidence of self-knowledge. You know what your goal is and are sure of its eventual fulfilment. Let
            your intuition and passion guide you as you confirm your next steps.</p>

            your personal goals. Consider what is truly important to you. You may have headed in
            one direction, only to realize it wasn’t in full alignment with your true values and purpose. This card
            invites you to go back to the drawing board and reconnect with your dreams and ambitions, then make the
            necessary adjustments.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Three of Wands signals the many chances available to you to broaden your horizons.
            You are becoming more aware of the opportunities that exist for you right now – and there are still more to
            come. To take advantage of this potential, you must stay committed to your path and be prepared to stretch
            beyond your comfort zone, knowing your best hopes lie outside of your current environment.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Three of Wands reversed suggests that growth and expansion are available to you,
            but you are choosing to play it safe and stay within your comfort zone. As a result, you are closing
            yourself off from new opportunity and limiting your potential.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">In numerology, four symbolises stability and firm foundations, and with the Four of
            Wands, you are now enjoying a period of happiness and security. This card indicates a sense of harmony and
            balance as well as completion and thus denotes a time of peace and contentment in life that comes as the
            result of hard-fought efforts.</p>

          <h3>&#10023 Reversed &#10023</h3>
          <p class="flavor-text">Personal celebration, inner harmony, conflict with others, transition</p>
          <p class="card-summary">Given the upright Four of Wands reflects stability, the reversal of this card can
            suggest that you are going through an upheaval during which you have little stability and security. You may
            experience multiple changes in your life. While you know this is an important transition – one you need to
            make – it can be quite unsettling, knocking you out of balance and making you feel uncertain about your
            future.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Conflict, disagreements, competition, tension</p>
          <p class="card-summary">In the Tarot, the Fives typically represent conflict and change, and the Five of Wands
            is no exception. This card indicates that you are in the midst of battle, tension, and competition with
            others and it is impacting your ability to move forward with your goals. Rather than being able to work
            towards a common goal, you are running up against constant opposition.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Inner conflict, conflict avoidance, tension release</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Five of Wands reversed can suggest that you have the tendency to avoid conflict
            wherever feasible. The trouble, however, is that in doing this you may just be pushing some of your concerns
            to the side without dealing with them or asserting your point of view. Some conflict can be useful,
            particularly if it is constructive and draws out the underlying issues in a way that then generates a better
            solution.</p>

            quite at the finish line just yet. You still have some way to go, and challenges may sit on the path ahead –
            but take heart knowing you have the support of those around you and they are here to back you</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The reversed Six of Wands encourages you to create your own definition of success. If
            you have found yourself seeking approval and validation or comparing yourself to others, you may have
            stripped yourself of your personal power and self-belief. When you are clear about what success means to
            you, you will make better decisions that are more in alignment with who you really are, and increase your
            confidence and independence.</p>

            an external source. Someone or something may get in the way of you being able to pursue your goals and
            dreams. While it appears to block your path forward, you can overcome this obstacle by drawing upon your
            strong self-confidence, self-belief, and continual self-improvement.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Seven of Wands reversed shows that external pressure is weighing you down, leaving
            you doubting yourself and whether everything is worth it. It may seem as if you are under constant
            opposition. At first, you could hold firm, but after a relentless battle, you are now exhausted and ready to
            give up altogether. Stand strong, own your position and don’t change who you are just to keep others happy.

            you are unfairly targeted. Often, this is a sign of fear from within you rather than an actual external
            threat. Focus on your own game and don’t worry about what other people are thinking or saying about you.</p>
