          <p class="flavor-text">Love, new relationships, compassion, creativity</p>
          <p class="card-summary">This card often appears in Tarot readings when you are open to creative expression,
            especially when you can allow your emotions to shine through your endeavours. You may be inspired to start
            something new. You see fresh potential in allowing your creative juices to flow. Let your imagination and
            talent unfurl to new possibilities.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Self-love, intuition, repressed emotions</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Ace of Cups reversed may be a sign that you are repressing your emotions, not
            wanting to express yourself fully to the outside world. You have your reasons for keeping your feelings
            close and not wanting others to know what’s going on inside. You may feel embarrassed or afraid of what
            might happen if you were to express your emotions. be careful that you do not create an internal blockage by
            repressing how you feel. If you are not ready to share your emotions – that's okay! You can find ways to
            release them privately.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Unified love, partnership, mutual attraction</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Two of Cups is the flow of love between two people. With this card, you are
            creating deep connections and partnerships, based on shared values and compassion. This
            relationship could be a lover, a friendship, or a business partnership - no matter what this card signifies
            you are both focused on creating a relationship that is mutually beneficial.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Self-love, break-ups, disharmony, distrust</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Two of Cups reversed can sometimes signal a break-up or a falling out. You are out
            of sync with each other and don‘t share the same emotional connection you did in the past. You may notice a
            lack of trust and being open with one another is proving difficult. Communication may be restricted, and the
            energy flow between you stifled. To turn this situation around, open up, share, and hold a
            safe space for one another to express your feelings.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Celebration, friendship, creativity, collaborations</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Three of Cups represents groups coming together to focus on a common emotional
            goal. People reach out emotionally to one another. It speaks of a sense of community, and can indicate the
            time to get more involved by helping.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Independence, alone time</p>
          <p class="card-summary">While the upright Three of Cups is a card of friendship and social events, the
            reversal of this card suggests that you would prefer to go it alone right now. You may have recently spent a
            lot of time with others and now just need some alone time. Honor your desire to step out of the social
            scene for a while and enjoy this time by yourself so you can get clear on who you most want to connect with
            in the future.</p>

          <p class="flavor-text">Meditation, contemplation, apathy, reevaluation</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Four of Cups can appear when you are bored or dissatisfied with your everyday
            life. You may feel disengaged, apathetic or unmotivated – maybe life has become dull. The Four of Cups
            invites you to bring your attention inward and re-evaluate your situation to find a deeper meaning in what
            you do.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Four of Cups reversed reflects a period of introspection and withdrawal. You are
            retreating into your own inner world so you can concentrate on what is integral to you and what grounds you.
            Just be careful that you don’t shut off your friends and loved ones or appear disinterested in their lives.
            Let them know you need some alone time and that you’ll reach out again when you’re ready to re-emerge.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Five of Cups suggests you’re stuck in the past and can’t let go. Old wounds and
            bitter memories flood your mind as you think about what happened. You may blame yourself or believe you’re a
            victim of life’s circumstances. These negative emotions are holding you back from your fullest potential –
            release them so you can move on and create positive change.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">When this card turns up in a Tarot reading, you are realising the full implications of
            the past, and you appreciate the lessons learned from the experience. You may even recognise the value of

          <p class="flavor-text">Revisiting the past, childhood memories, innocence, joy</p>
          <p class="card-summary">The Six of Cups upright generally represents generosity, naïve happiness, and
            childhood. It can stand for you wanting to return to a happier time. You may feel that remembering these
            times is the only way to feel happy. The Six of Cups appearing in a reading seems to indicate that while we
            may look upon the past with a happy eye, we must avoid living in it.</p>

          <h3>&#10023 Reversed &#10023</h3>
          <p class="flavor-text">Living in the past, forgiveness</p>
          <p class="card-summary">When the reversed Six of Cups appears in a reading, ask whether you're clinging to the
            past and losing touch with the present. Nostalgia may bring up positive or negative feelings,
            but either way, when you find yourself wishing for ‘how things used to be’ and not living in the present,
            you miss out on the opportunities right in front of you. It's ok to indulge a little in reminiscing about
            the past, as long as you understand that true and lasting change can only happen in the present moment.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The Seven of Cups may be a sign of ‘shiny object syndrome’, where you keep finding the
            ‘next big thing’ but fail to see any of those new opportunities through to the end. When you are constantly
            in the idea phase, you miss the chance to bring your designs into fruition.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">As a card of choices and options, the reversed Seven of Cups can mean you are
            overwhelmed by choice and cannot move forward. Reduce your options and focus on what is important to you.
            You don’t need to keep searching for that big idea; you have what you need. Make your pick and move forward

            longer getting anything out of this situation. Now, the only choice is to put it behind you and move on with

            dreams. You may need to tweak your goals to keep them in full alignment with your personal values. And you
